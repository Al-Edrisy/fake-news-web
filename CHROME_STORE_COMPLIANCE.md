# Chrome Web Store Compliance Changes

## Issue Addressed

The Chrome Web Store reviewer flagged the extension for having "broad host permissions" due to the use of `"matches": ["<all_urls>"]` in the content scripts section of the manifest.

## Changes Made

### 1. Manifest.json Updates

**Before:**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage", 
    "contextMenus",
    "notifications"
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "contextMenus", 
    "notifications",
    "scripting"
  ]
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed the `content_scripts` section entirely
- Added `"scripting"` permission to enable dynamic content script injection
- Content scripts are now injected only when needed using `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`

### 2. Background Script Updates

**New Functionality:**
- Added `injectContentScriptAndSendMessage()` function for dynamic injection
- Added `chrome.action.onClicked` listener to inject content script when extension icon is clicked
- Added message listener to handle verification requests from content script
- Modified `safeSendMessage()` to inject content script if not already present

**Benefits:**
- Content scripts are only injected when user explicitly interacts with the extension
- Reduces the extension's footprint on web pages
- Improves security by limiting script injection to user-initiated actions

### 3. Content Script Updates

**New Functionality:**
- Added `showFloatingVerifyButton()` function for manual activation
- Added message listener for `showFloatingButton` action
- Maintains existing floating button functionality for text selection

### 4. Privacy Policy Updates

Updated the privacy policy to reflect:
- New `scripting` permission explanation
- Dynamic content script injection process
- More accurate description of data processing

## Security Improvements

### Before (Broad Permissions):
- Content script injected on ALL websites automatically
- Extension had access to every page without user interaction
- Higher security risk and privacy concerns

### After (ActiveTab + Scripting):
- Content script only injected when user clicks extension icon or uses context menu
- Extension requires explicit user interaction to access page content
- More secure and privacy-friendly approach

## User Experience Impact

### Positive Changes:
- **Better Privacy**: Extension only activates when user wants it to
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: No unnecessary script injection on every page
- **Clearer Intent**: User explicitly chooses when to use the extension

### Maintained Functionality:
- Text selection verification still works
- Context menu integration preserved
- All verification features remain available
- Floating button appears when extension icon is clicked

## Chrome Web Store Compliance

These changes address the reviewer's concerns by:

1. **Eliminating Broad Host Permissions**: No more `"<all_urls>"` matching
2. **Using ActiveTab Permission**: Extension only accesses tabs when user interacts
3. **Dynamic Script Injection**: Scripts injected only when needed
4. **Explicit User Consent**: All actions require user interaction

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing these changes, test:

1. **Extension Icon Click**: Should inject content script and show floating button
2. **Text Selection**: Should show floating verify button (after clicking extension icon first)
3. **Context Menu**: Should still work for selected text
4. **Verification Process**: Should work as before
5. **Multiple Tabs**: Should work independently on each tab
6. **Page Navigation**: Should require re-activation on new pages

### Important Note:
**Text selection functionality now requires user to click the extension icon first** to inject the content script. This is a privacy improvement that ensures the extension only activates when the user explicitly wants to use it.

## Deployment Notes

1. **Version Update**: Increment version number in manifest.json
2. **Build Process**: Run `npm run build` to generate updated extension
3. **Testing**: Test thoroughly before resubmitting to Chrome Web Store
4. **Documentation**: Update any user documentation to reflect new activation method

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a popup interface for the extension icon
- Implement user onboarding to explain the new activation method
- Add visual indicators when the extension is active on a page
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for quick activation
